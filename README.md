# My Portfolio Site & Blog
I used GatsbyJS and a free starter template from HTML5 UP setup for Gatsby by Hunter Chang (ChangoMan) to completely redesign my site and update it in about a day.

This was a big win for me because I had been putting off this redesign and how long it would take. (My first portfolio site was built from scratch and took several days.)

Once I had decided to use some kind of existing framework to help me with the site and then picked one, the process went very smoothly! I surprised myself by how much I've learned since I built my first site and by how much Gatsby takes care of in the process.

## See It Live

Hosted with Netlify, the site automatically rebuilds and deploys when I push changes to GitHub. 
Continuous Deployment has always seemed a little daunting to setup to me so I was impressed by 
how easy it was and how well it works.
