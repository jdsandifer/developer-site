# My Portfolio Site & Blog
I used GatsbyJS and a free starter template from HTML5 UP setup for Gatsby by Hunter Chang (ChangoMan) to completely redesign my site and update it in about a day.

This was a big win for me because I had been putting off this redesign and how long it would take. (My first portfolio site was built from scratch and took several days.)

Once I had decided to use some kind of existing framework to help me with the site and the picked one, the process went very smoothly! I surprised myself by how much I've learned since I built my first site and by how much Gatsby takes care of in the process.

## See It Live

Coming soon! Still working out my hosting solution - hopefully, with auto reload when I push to GitHub.

## Stuff I Used

Site: GatsbyJS with React, HTML5, Sass, GraphQL, and Font Awesome
Design: Strata Gatsby starter by HTML5 UP.
