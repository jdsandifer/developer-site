        <h1>Useful Sound Technician Resources</h1>
        <p>Please excuse the barebones nature of this page - done is better than perfect, right?</p>

        <h2>How to Use a Microphone (And More)</h2>
        <p>If you stumbled upon this page and aren't a sound technician, but interact with sound equipment in one way or another, then these links might be for you. (Also useful for sound techs when you need to explain a concept to a speaker or musician.) </p>
        <ul>

        </ul>

        <h2>Learning to Hear Sound</h2>
        <p>It's a visual world - learning to hear as well as we see is difficult. Here are some things to help with that.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This section is under construction...</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Is Good Sound?</h2>
        <p>Resources to help you know what things should sound like. Knowing what you're aiming for is half the battle.</p>
        <ul>

You can't make amateur performers or budget instruments sound like they aren't, but you <em>can</em> help them get a little closer!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Mix</h2>
        <p>What's gain? How do I make that sound less harsh? What do you call the thing that makes levels more balanced? Answers to those questions and more...</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFHUyHKAjpavtIBJBak50MR3-X-bJHmKE">Getting Good Sounds Video Playlist</a> - As always, skip to the videos that picque your interest.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practice Mixing</h2>
        <p>Links for how to practice mixing when you don't have a band and console in front of you. Practice makes better, but you can't just take the console home with you...</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.reaper.fm/">Reaper Digital Audio Workstation</a> - Reaper is my DAW software of choice: It's truly free to demo and inexpensive to buy.</li>

(The page is a little confusing - you want the big box in the middle partway down for previews and download links.)</li>
            <li><a href="http://behindthespeakers.com/300-free-multitracks/">Lots of Multitrack Sites</a> - It might be a little intimidating, but just click on the first link that looks good and continue until you find a multitrack you like or hit a dead end. Repeat as needed!</li>

        <h2>Acoustics &amp; Other Advanced Topics</h2>
        <p>These links may or may not make you a better sound technician, but they might be useful if you ever get the chance to do some trickier stuff - like supervise a sound system install or contribute to the design of a venue.</p>
